This plugin is built for people keen to reuse flickr images in their blogs. Searching for just CC-BY material the plugin helps to make using flickr content much more simple.

== Description ==
This plugin was developed for the Politics InSpires (http://politicsinspires.org) project at the University of Oxford.

The project was JISC Funded, and sits as part of "Open Spires" (ttp://openspires.oucs.ox.ac.uk/). Open Spires  is a project led by the Learning Technologies Group, Oxford University Computing Services, University of Oxford.

In terms of long term support, the code is being maintained by the Open Attribute team (http://openattribute.com).

The plugin allows for a user to simply search Flickr for content, and then for the user to simply add attribution to the picture before adding it into their post. By using CC-BY licenses this tool is built to limit the potential copyright pitfalls that may occur.

A more powerful sister plug in is available which searches for more than just CC-BY.
